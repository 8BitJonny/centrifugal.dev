HTTP streaming connection endpoint in Centrifugo is:

```
/connection/http_stream
```

:::info

This transport is only implemented by our Javascript SDK at this point â€“ as it mostly makes sense as a fallback for WebSocket to have real-time connection in an environment where WebSocket is unavailable. These days those envs are mostly corporate networks which can block WebSocket traffic (even TLS-based).
