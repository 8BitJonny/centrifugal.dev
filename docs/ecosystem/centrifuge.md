title: Centrifuge library
---

Centrifugo is built on top of [Centrifuge](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge) library for Go language.

Due to its standalone language-agnostic nature Centrifugo dictates some rules developers should follow when integrating. If you need more freedom and a more tight integration of real-time server with application business logic you may consider using Centrifuge library to build something similar to Centrifugo but with customized behavior. Centrifuge library can be considered as Socket.IO analogue in Go language ecosystem.

Library [README](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge#readme) has detailed description, link to examples and [introduction post](/blog/2021/01/15/centrifuge-intro).

Many Centrifugo features should be re-implemented when using Centrifuge - like API layer, admin web UI, proxy etc (if you need those of course). And you need to write in Go language. But the core functionality like a client-server protocol (all Centrifugo client SDKs work with Centrifuge library based server) and Redis engine to scale come out of the box â€“ in most cases this is enough to start building an app.

:::tip

Many things said in Centrifugo doc can be considered as an extra documentation for Centrifuge library (for example part about infrastructure tuning or transport description). But not all of them.
