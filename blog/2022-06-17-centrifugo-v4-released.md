Today we are happy to announce the next generation of Centrifugo – Centrifugo v4. We believe that this release puts Centrifugo to the next level in terms of ease of adoption, SDK ecosystem and channel security model.

## Centrifugo v3 flashbacks

As usual, let's look back a bit. Centrifugo v3 was released last year. It had a great list of improvements – like unidirectional transports support (EventSource, HTTP-streaming and GRPC), GRPC transport for proxy, history iteration API, faster JSON protocol, and more.

During Centrifugo v3 lifecycle we added additional JSON protocol speedups and support for granular proxy mode.

But Centrifugo v3 did not contain nothing... let's say **revolutional**. Revolutional for Centrifugo itself, or even for the entire open-source real-time messaging area.

In this release we feel that the revolution in some aspects had happened. Let's talk about it and introduce all the major things of v4 release.
